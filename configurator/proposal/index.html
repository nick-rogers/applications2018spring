  	<h1>Configuration Project Proposal</h1>
  	<h2>Nick Rogers: Ramen selector project</h2>
  	<p>I would like to make a project that walks a user through the process of creating their own custom bowl of ramen, with all the necessary noodles, meats, broths, etc, and gives them a set of packaging, delivery, and pickup options when it is complete, much in the way a real restaurant application would function</p>
  	<p>The visual approach would be clean and three-dimensional, with the selection process consisting of an above-bowl view of the ramen, where the user can click, drag, or add any ingredients they wish to the bowl at each stage.</p>
	<p>Ideally, this project will an option for visual exploration in creating a simple and aesthetically pleasing interface, but also one that is highly usable and intuitive for any audience. The project will be executed in html</p>
