  		<h1>User Stories Existing Site: Clair</h1>
  		<ul>
  			<div class="wrapper">
	  			<li>As Clair, I visit Nashbar.com because it was the first link to appear upon looking up "Bike Shopping Website." I do so because the site is high-rated.</li>
	  			<li>As Clair, I scroll down the page a bit because I don't see any obvious CTA for bikes, and I have come to the site for bikes specifically</li>
	  			<li>As Clair, after finding and clicking on the "Bikes and Frames" button in the navigation bar, I am confronted with a dropdown that contains several categories including many categories. I click on the 'Shop all bikes and frames" button because I do not know exactly what differences exist between the types of bikes and don't want to limit my options</li>
	  			<li>As Clair, I want to find a section that shows many bikes or one that informs me on the different types of bikes, beacause though I have knowledge on bikes, I would still like to see bikes before knowing exactly what I am looking for</li>
	  			<li>As Clair, I attempt to click on the prices ranges that appear active and proceed to not change or show any products. So, I click on the "Road Bikes" Section of the page because it's the first one and it sounds like it may apply to me, as I am looking for a bike that could ride on roads, though also maybe trails?</li>
	  			<li>As Clair, I want to know exactly what these bikes are designed for, so I read the small summary at the top of the page</li>
	  			<li>As Clair, I want to be responsible with my money, so once I can I sort the bikes by price, noticing that the prices of road bikes are very high</li>
	  			<li>As Clair, I click on the tab for gender and choose unisex because I don't want to narrow down my options yet, I want to make sure I get a quality product that will last a long time. </li>
	  			<li>As Clair, I am interested in how the bike will look, though not obsessed with it. So, I click on the color options in the PGP, and see that no change occurs. </li>
	  			<li>As Clair, I click on the Nashbar flat bar road bike because it has a good rating and reviews, and I want to find out what people think about the product</li>
	  			<li>As Clair, I look at the specifications page but see that there are a great many categories and many of them are bike components that I do not really know</li>
	  			<li>As Clair, I read the reviews and all their sections because I want to make sure this bike will ride well and last a long time. This is no small purchase</li>
	  			<li>As Clair, I am gladdened by the good reviews but decide to keep shopping because of warnings about the tires and their likelihood of flats</li>
	  			<li>As Clair, I open a new tab and keep the old one, clicking then on the "Hybrids, Commuters and Cruisers" tab because I am looking to see if I'd be interested, and know that they sound more applicable to me than mountain bikes</li>
	  			<li>As Clair, I click over to the mountain bike tab after seeing the same bike I was already viewing in the last section, and no other bikes that seemed to top that one in rating and afforability</li>
	  			<li>As Clair, I sort by price and then look through the bikes, clicking on the cheap, well-reviewed one</li>
	  			<li>As Clair, though I like the durability of this mountain bike I click back over to the original bike and check out, because the mountain bike was more expensive and I feel that the road bike would be more useful when out and riding with my dogs, and would likely last a decent amount of time. If I decide to take it off road, I can get more robust tires later</li>
